## Book an audit
If you are a founder or engineer looking to get your smart contract protocol audited, you can contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maslarovk), [Telegram](https://t.me/maslarovk), or Discord to discuss your needs and help you secure your project.

**As we would like to provide the best and most client oriented experience, we propose multiple pricing models in order to match your needs:**
 - Pay-Per-Vulnerability (PPV) model with a small base fee which is formed based on nSloc and complexity and is paid prior the audit. After that our pricing is as follows:
    - High: $1000
    - Medium: $500
    - Low: $100
    - Informational: Free of charge

 - Fixed Price, if you select this model we are going to:
    - Spend some time to make a high level overview of the codebase.
    - Present visible at first sight issues.
    - Propose the quote and timeframe.
